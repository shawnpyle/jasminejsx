# Overview

A version of [jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io) that works with Adobe ExtendScript.  ExtendScript is a JavaScript variant that allows you to create and run scripts that extend Adobe's Creative Suite.

# Environment

This has been developed and tested on 
* Mac OS X 10.14.5 with Adobe InDesign CC 2019
* Mac OS X 10.14.5 with Adobe InDesign CC 2020
* Mac OS X 10.15.3 with Adobe InDesign CC 2020

All but the command line `test/run` (described below) should work on other platforms.

This uses an old version of [jasmine v2.6](https://jasmine.github.io/2.6/introduction) since ExtendScript is so old.

# Installation

Simply install it like any other npm package. Nice [npm setup tutorial here](https://www.sitepoint.com/beginners-guide-node-package-manager/).

```sh
npm install jasminejsx
```

You may also elect to add it to your `package.json` as development dependency:

```json
"devDependencies": {
  "jasminejsx": "^0.1.0"
}
```

and install with a `npm install`.

# Usage

1. Create a `test/spec` directory for your `*Spec.jsx` files.
1. In your `test/` folder, create your own `run.jsx` file that will bootstrap your testing environment. Here's what it should look like:

    ```js
    // Define your root path - this will be the folder that contains your node_modules folder
    var Global = Global || {};
    Global.rootPath = new File($.fileName).parent.parent;
    Global.modulesPath = new File(Global.rootPath + '/node_modules');

    // Define an optional Logger to override default
    // $.evalFile(Global.modulesPath + '/extendscript-logger/index.jsx');
    // Global.logger = new Logger(Global.rootPath+'/log/mytestlog.log', 'DEBUG');
    
    //Configuration options
    //Global.jasminejsx = Global.jasminejsx || {}
    //Global.jasminejsx.specPath = new File(Global.rootPath + '/test/spec');
    //Global.jasminejsx.reportPending = true; //defaults to false
    //Global.jasminejsx.activateApp = true; //defaults to false
    
    //Load the jasminejsx setup
    //@include '../node_modules/jasminejsx/index.jsx'

    // Sanity check, you can delete this after you verify your root path is correct.
    Global.logger.info('Global.rootPath is: ' + Global.rootPath);

    // Run Jasmine
    $.evalFile(Global.modulesPath + '/jasminejsx/test/run.jsx');
    ```

    You can run this script in a few ways:

    * You can run this through the InDesign Scripts panel if it is linked properly to the `Scripts/Scripts Panel/` directory inside your Adobe InDesign application directory.
    * You can run this from VS Code using [Adobe's ExtendScript Debugger](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Adobe.extendscript-debug). Just create a debug configuration that points to it.
    * You can run it from within [Adobe ExtendScript Toolkit](https://www.adobe.com/devnet/scripting/estk.html). Not recommended as [future development is not in the works for ESTK](https://medium.com/adobetech/workaround-for-extendscript-toolkit-debugger-error-1116-f067f81f96c6). 
    * From the command line - see below.

3. If you want to be able to run these test from the command line, link to the `node_modules/jasminejsx/test/run` file. This currently only works with OSX machines as it uses JavaScript for automation to open InDesign and run the tests.

    ```bash
    ln -s ../node_modules/jasminejsx/test/run test/run
    ```

4. Run all tests with `test/run` or specific tests with `test/run CalculatorSpec`.

# Testing

`npm test` or `test/run`

Output should look like:

```
me@host$ test/run

# NPM Release Tasks

1. Update `package.json` version number
1. `npm install` to update package lock.
1. `npm test` to ensure tests pass.
1. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with changes since last release.
1. Check them all into the repository.
1. `git tag -a <version> -m <version>; git push --tags`
1. `npm publish` to deploy the release to npm.
